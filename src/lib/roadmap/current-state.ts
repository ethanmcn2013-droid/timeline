/**
 * Current-state verdict, the public page's single-glance read.
 *
 * One plain-English line above the workspace title that answers the
 * recipient's first question, "where does this stand?", before they
 * parse a single row:
 *
 *   - "On track for {date}."          nothing dated is behind, nothing waiting
 *   - "Aiming for {date}."            something is late or waiting, honest,
 *                                      without broadcasting counts the owner
 *                                      didn't choose to publish
 *   - "Everything here has shipped."  no upcoming milestone, all work settled
 *
 * The degradation is deliberate taste: the public share is the owner's
 * face to their client. The verb carries the truth ("aiming" is not
 * "on track"); the receipts (which items, how late) stay on owner
 * surfaces via the needs-attention signal this module reuses.
 *
 * Pure module, callers pass `now` explicitly, same contract as
 * needs-attention.ts, so tests and ISR-rendered output are stable.
