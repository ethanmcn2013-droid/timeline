/**
 * The anchor, the one dated day a whole plan is pointed at, and the
 * countdown to it.
 *
 * A plan of this shape, a wedding, a go-live, a launch, is built toward a
 * single day. That day is the anchor. It is NOT the same as the "next
 * milestone" (the soonest thing ahead): the next milestone is a waypoint,
 * the anchor is the destination. A wedding plan has a menu tasting next
 * week and the wedding in seven weeks, the countdown a couple wants to
 * feel is the second one.
 *
 * Nothing here is persisted. The anchor is DERIVED from the milestone
 * flags Tasks already owns (schema.ts is derived from Tasks and must not
 * gain a Roadmap-only field), so there is no new column, migration, or
 * query, only a reading of data the workspace already has.
 *
 * Two registers of output share one calculation:
 *   - countdownToken, the mono operator readout   ("T-47" · "Today" · "−3d")
 *   - countdownPhrase, the plain-English recipient line ("47 days from now")
 *
 * `now` is injectable on every function so ISR-rendered output and tests
 * are deterministic, the same contract as current-state.ts and
 * needs-attention.ts.
